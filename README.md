# Consensys Solidity Bootcamp Final Project

I have two ideas:

1. An NFT that is minted 1:1 with wBTC.
2. A smart contract that sits atop Yearn and sends the yield to a different address. An example use case would be recurring donations to a charity or DAO. A user still owns their ETH but the interest is automatically donated.
